                    <p>Our solar system is in the Milky Way galaxy and located in an outer spiral arm. This is where we
                        call
                        “home.” The solar system is made up of some major and minor players, all of which interact with
                        each
                        other. The solar system consists of our sun, which is a star, and all that its gravity affects.
                        The
                        planets in our solar system are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
                        Neptune.

                    <p>
                        The solar system has eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
                        Uranus,
                        and
                        Neptune.
                        The first four planets from the Sun are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These inner
                        planets
                        also
                        are known as terrestrial planets because they have solid surfaces.
                        The giant planets in the outer solar system don't have hard surfaces. Instead, they have
                        swirling
                        gases above a core. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants. Uranus and Neptune are ice
                        giants.

                        <p>The Sombrero galaxy is considered to be one of the most unusual of the barred spiral
                            galaxies. The
                            official designation of this galaxy is M104 or NGC 4594. As you can guess by the name, it is
                            in the
                            shape of the Mexican sombrero hat, and appears white and brilliant bright with a bulbous
                            core that
                            is surrounded by thick dust lanes that makes up the spirals. A dust lane is the location in
                            a galaxy
                            where stars are formed. This galaxy contains many areas that include all of the elements for
                            being a
                            star nursery. The halo that surrounds the disc is bigger than most and gives it the unique
                            sombrero
                            shape. Like most other galaxies, it’s believed that the Sombrero galaxy has a center that
                            contains a
                            massive black hole.</p>
