                    <p>Our solar system is in the Milky Way galaxy and located in an outer spiral arm. This is where we
                        call
                        “home.” The solar system is made up of some major and minor players, all of which interact with
                        each
                        other. The solar system consists of our sun, which is a star, and all that its gravity affects.
                        The
                        planets in our solar system are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
                        Neptune.

                        The solar system has eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
                        Uranus,
                        and
                        Neptune.
                        The first four planets from the Sun are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These inner
                        planets
                        also
                        are known as terrestrial planets because they have solid surfaces.
                        The giant planets in the outer solar system don't have hard surfaces. Instead, they have
                        swirling
                        gases above a core. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants. Uranus and Neptune are ice
                        giants.

                    <h1>GALAXIES</h1>
                    <p>Galaxies are huge spans of gas, dust, dark matter, and from a million to trillions of stars.
                        Everything in a galaxy is bound by gravity. Each star in a galaxy is a sun and there are
                        thousands
                        of solar systems in every galaxy. The idea of galaxies is almost too much for us to
                        comprehend,
                        especially because scientists are finding thousands of them out in the universe.

                    <h1>Andromeda Galaxy</h1>
                    <p>The Andromeda Galaxy is also known as “M31” and is a spiral galaxy and the closest
                        neighboring galaxy
                        to our Milky Way. As Andromeda moves through the universe it is bringing along 14 dwarf
                        galaxies,
                        including M32, M110, and M33 (Triangulum Galaxy) It’s one of the few galaxies that we can
                        see from
                        Earth, and that’s saying a lot since it is 2.5 million light-years away from us.</p>

                    <h1>Milky Way Galaxy </h1>
                    <p>For thousands of years, people of all different cultures around the world have gazed up at
                        the skies
                        and watched the beauty of our Milky Way galaxy. Our solar system, including our sun and all
                        of the
                        planets and objects within it, is just a small part of the Milky Way galaxy. All of the
                        stars that
                        we see in the night sky are part of our galaxy, and when you think of the number of them,
                        it’s
                        almost overwhelming.</p>

                    <h1>Pinwheel Galaxy</h1>
                    <p>Although the Pinwheel galaxy is around 21 million light-years from Earth, it has been viewed
                        with the
                        naked eye by people all over the world for thousands of years.
                        This galaxy is also around 70% bigger than our Milky Way galaxy, and on a clear dark night
                        in areas
                        that don’t have light interference from cities or towns, you can see the Pinwheel galaxy
                        with a
                        small telescope or binoculars.
                        The near-perfect spiral of the Pinwheel galaxy displays the dust lanes in the arms of the
                        galaxy
                        that spiral and extend all of the way around the galaxy body.</p>

                    <h1>Sombrero Galaxy </h1>
                    <p>The Sombrero galaxy is considered to be one of the most unusual of the barred spiral
                        galaxies. The
                        official designation of this galaxy is M104 or NGC 4594. As you can guess by the name, it is
                        in the
                        shape of the Mexican sombrero hat, and appears white and brilliant bright with a bulbous
                        core that
                        is surrounded by thick dust lanes that makes up the spirals. A dust lane is the location in
                        a galaxy
                        where stars are formed. This galaxy contains many areas that include all of the elements for
                        being a
                        star nursery. The halo that surrounds the disc is bigger than most and gives it the unique
                        sombrero
                        shape. Like most other galaxies, it’s believed that the Sombrero galaxy has a center that
                        contains a
                        massive black hole.</p>
